# CG Precision Comparisons

Compare data types to see if the floating level will change the iteration counts and answer vectors of a preconditioned conjugate gradient algorithm. 

## How to use
* Pick all the matrix market matricies (.MTX files) to test and put them in the test_subjects directory
* run 
* The output will print and write in real time

## implementations

Conjugate Gradient Algorithm has been implemented in C, Octave/Matlab, and CUDA
